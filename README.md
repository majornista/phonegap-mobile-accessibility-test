MobileAccessibilityTest
=======================

A test application for the PhoneGap Mobile Accessibility plugin.

This application provides a demonstration of how to use the [Phone Gap Mobile Accessibility plugin](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-mobile-accessibility/) to retrieve the status of accessibility services running on iOS and Android devices, how to respond to changes in status when the services are enabled or disabled, how to send basic accessibility notifications from your app, and how to send a text string to be announced by a screen reader or presented in braille.  

The app should be compatible with iOS 5+ and Android 4.0+, and I've included the platform projects in the repository.
